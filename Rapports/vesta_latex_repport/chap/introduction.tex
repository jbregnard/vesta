\section{Introduction}

This semester project takes part of the CHIC2015 which is a new project initiated at EPFL by Marc Laperrouza. The goal of this new project is for students develop a project from idea to production in a semester. Indeed a trip to Shenzhen in China is programmed following the end of the semester(july). We are heading to a prototyping facility ther called Seeedstudio. They mainly do pcb prototyping but they also mill and 3d print parts.

Three groups of 5 people are created after a brainstorming week-end at the beggining of the semester with for each group one HEC (economy) student, one ECAL (industrial design) student and three engineers from EPFL. For the project presented in this report, two engineers are from microengineering and one is from material science.

After the brainstorming week-end, the rough idea was to connect elderly people to their families with an easy to use electronic device.
