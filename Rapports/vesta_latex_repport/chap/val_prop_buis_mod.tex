\section{Value Proposition and Business Model}
The hypothethis is made that the customers and the users of this product are different. Indeed the people buying the device will be the family of the elder(s). While the elders will be the end users. Therefore the needs of the buyers and of the users are different. They will be both be using the device but through two different interfaces.

The value proposion canvas template used for the analysis is the one pictured in Figure~\ref{}.
