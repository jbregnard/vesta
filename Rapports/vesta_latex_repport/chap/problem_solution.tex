\subsection{Vesta tab}
The Vesta tab is a tablet oriented towards the elderly. It has a capacitive touch screen, a wifi and bluetooth connection and a unique casing. The main usage at the moment is receiving and displaying pictures and text sent by the younger family via the dedicated website. As soon as a new image or text is received an LED blinks to inform the user of new content. The interface is designed to be very user friendly and easy to use.
