\section{Next steps}

In the beginning of july, a first prototype will be made in Shenzen (China) with an industrial partner (Seedstudio). A final presentation of the project is going to take place in october with the prototype.

A lot of fonctionnalities could be easily implemented after this prototyping step. An activity monitoring or an emergency call system for example. An other fonctionnality can be to have a visioconference system with a camera like Skype do. This device has a lot of unused connections that could be use to connect other sensors for medical assistance. It can becomes an electrocardiogram for example. The advantage is that the hardware is powerful enough to do almost everything a computer can do in therm of connectivity. Everything that can be done with a tablet can be done with this device and more.
